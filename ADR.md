# Architecture Decision Record (ADR) - Dynamics 365 Customer Service Case Management for Call Centre

## Title

Adoption of Dynamics 365 Customer Service for Case Management in Call Centre

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our call centre requires an efficient case management system to handle customer inquiries, complaints, and service requests. The current system lacks automation, integration with other enterprise applications, and real-time analytics. As the business scales, the need for a modern, cloud-based solution that enhances agent productivity and customer satisfaction has become imperative.

## Decision

We have decided to adopt Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Service as the primary case management system for the call centre. This decision is based on its ability to provide:

Omnichannel support (phone, chat, email, social media, etc.).

AI-driven insights and automation capabilities.

Seamless integration with Microsoft 365, Power Platform, and third-party applications.

Configurable workflows and business rules for case escalation and resolution.

Real-time reporting and dashboards for performance monitoring.

A cloud-based architecture ensuring scalability and security.

## Consequences

Positive Consequences

Improved Agent Productivity: Automated case routing and AI-powered suggestions help agents resolve cases faster.

Enhanced Customer Experience: Omnichannel support allows customers to engage on their preferred platforms.

Better Decision-Making: Real-time analytics and reporting provide actionable insights.

Scalability and Flexibility: The cloud-based solution can scale as per business needs.

Seamless Integration: Native integration with other Microsoft products and APIs for third-party applications.

Negative Consequences

Learning Curve: Agents and administrators will require training to adapt to the new system.

Implementation Costs: Licensing, customization, and data migration efforts could be costly.

Change Management: Resistance from employees may require a structured change management approach.

## Alternatives Considered

### Custom-Built Solution

Pros: Tailored to specific business needs.

Cons: High development and maintenance costs; longer implementation time.

### Other CRM Solutions (e.g., Salesforce, Zendesk)

Pros: Competitive feature sets and capabilities.

Cons: Higher integration complexity with existing Microsoft ecosystem.

### Status Quo (Retaining the Current System)

Pros: No immediate cost.

Cons: Lacks modern capabilities, scalability, and efficiency.
